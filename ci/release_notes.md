# Improvements

- `genesis deploy` now only redacts in CI/CD pipelines and when
  run non-interactively (i.e. when not attached to a controlling
  terminal).

- `genesis secrets` now properly detects a missing environment
  name, instead of throwing obtuse errors about uninitialized
  variables in pattern matching.

- When running in debug mode, genesis now runs curl with the `-v`
  flag, so that operators can see what headers and responses are
  being sent across the wire.

- Genesis pipeline steps now print the version of Genesis that
  they are running, to ease debugging / troubleshooting of
  pipeline weirdness.

- Genesis pipelines can now be configured in `unredacted: yes`
  mode, causing them to run `genesis deploy` without redaction.
  This has the potential to leak sensitive credentials like
  passwords and keys, so use this with caution, and only on
  secure Concourse installations that are not publicly viewable.

- `genesis compile-kit` now halts, refusing to compile the kit
  tarball, if you have unstaged or uncommitted changes to your
  working directory.

- `genesis create-kit` now populates a .gitignore with appropriate
  entries, to save you from the embarassment of commiting a
  compiled kit tarball to the git repo.

# Bug Fixes

- Fix bad reference in `valid_features()` helper made available to
  the blueprint hook.

# Kit Authoring Improvements

- Kit authors no longer have to define `meta.vault` as a concat of
  "secret/" and the `params.vault` value; Genesis now does this
  for you.  You are welcome.

- New unbounded maximum range validation: e.g.: 3+ for 3 or greater.
