#TODO: Cleanup hacky assertions into diags that print if tests fail:
# - Temporary bin/genesis-v1-..... was produced (when testing CTRL-C cleanup)
# - Killed genesis process (when testing CTRL-C cleanup)
# - Temporary bin/genesis-v1-..... was produced (when testing SIGTERM cleanup)
# - Killed genesis process (when testing SIGTERM cleanup)
# - Temporary bin/genesis-v1-..... was produced (when testing parent removal cleanup)
# - Killed genesis process (when testing parent removal cleanup)
#
# Change repeated code blocks in last three specs to test_until() function
# that can be used for that repeated code.
